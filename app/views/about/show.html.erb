  		</div>
  		<div class="panel-body">
    		Having been former employees at various restaurants and having all been brought up in almost every job available at such an establishment, we knew we wanted to take our hard earned experience and bring about our own dream of creating an eatery. Of course this was difficult, even a job as simple as busboy is filled with grit and sweat. But every job at a restaurant is valuable and we knew that our combined experiences would allow us to relate to every employ and establish a healthy relationship with all of our coworkers: a happy workforce is a productive one. But we refuse to let any attempt to make money overcome our desire to remain true to our roots, and we will always serve food that we are proud to both make and eat. At Heart and Soul, we serve authentic gluten free soul food, and if you donâ€™t have time to stay and eat, go ahead and carry out at our bakery. Cooking is an art form and our passion, now let us share that passion with you.

        How do you make bread products without gluten?
        <br>
        Our gluten-free bread uses Millet flour which is soft and tasty, and contains twice as much fiber as the more commonly used rice flours. We also use corn starch and a naturally gluten free yeast.
